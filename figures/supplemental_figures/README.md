## Discussion

The calendar effect on some of the simulations used to demonstrate the adjustment procedure can be demonstrated by simply plotting the adjusted data minus the unadjusted data.  Positive differences for temperature indicated where the adjusted data would be warmer than unadjusted data, and similarly for precipitation where adjusted data would be wetter than unadjusted data (see *Calendar effects* maps below).  

There are broad similarities across individual models for these *midHolocene* simulations, that resemble the "pure" calendar effects shown in Fig. 11 and 12, and the effects can be seen to rival in size the *midHolocene* minus *piControl* long-term mean differences (or "anomalies" -- see *Long-term mean differences* maps below).  In many cases the calendar effects simply reinforce the long-term mean differences, but in some cases they are large enough to change the sign of the difference (see *Long-term mean difference sign reversals* maps below).  The spatial patterns of the sign-change maps have two components:  1) large, or continental-scale patches that indicate where, and when during the year the calendar effect could completely reverse the sense of change between a paleo and control experiment, and 2) long looping, or hollow cell-like features that indicate where the location of zero isopleths of the long-term mean differences are sensitive to the calendar effect.

### Calendar effects

The .pdf files listed below show the calendar effects for some representative simulations, expressed as adjusted minus unadjusted values.  For *AClim* files, with time dimension lengths of 12, the maps are simple differences.  For *Amon* files, with varying time dimensions (often 1200, or 100 years of monthly data), the maps show differences in the long-term means for each month of the year (i.e. the "climatologies").

### Long-term mean differences (ltmdiff's)

The .pdf files listed below show the long-term mean differences for the CCM4 *Aclim* simulations, calculated using data adjusted for the calendar effect (`*_adj.pdf` files) as opposed to using unadjusted data (`*_noadj.pdf`).

### Long-term mean difference sign reversals

The .pdf files listed below show for the CCM4 *Aclim* simulations show locations where the calendar effect is sufficient in magnitude to reverse the sign of the *midHolocene* minus *piControl* long-term mean differences.
